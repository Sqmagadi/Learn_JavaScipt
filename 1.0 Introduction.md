# JavaScript

JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. It is commonly used to create dynamic and interactive elements in web applications. JavaScript is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform.

- JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.

- ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.


## Using JavaScript

In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between `<script>` and `</script> ` tags.

```
<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";
</script>
```

In HTML, javascript can be added both in the *head* or in within the *body*.

### Eternal JavaScript

To use an external Javascript, create a new file, For example:
`myScript.js`

External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages.

JavaScript files have the file extension `.js`.

To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a `<script> `tag:

```
<script src="myScript.js"></script>
```

You can use as many script files as you need to. All you need to do is to add all the script files to your HTML file:

```
<script src="myScript1.js"></script>
<script src="myScript2.js"></script>
<script src="myScript3.js"></script>
```

#### External JavaScript Advantages

- It separates HTML and code
- It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
- Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads
