# JavaScript

JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. It is commonly used to create dynamic and interactive elements in web applications. JavaScript is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform.

- JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.

- JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.

- JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.

- ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.


### Applications of JavaScript Programming

1. Client side validation − This is really important to verify any user input before submitting it to the server and JavaScript plays an important role in validating those inputs at front-end itself.

2. Manipulating HTML Pages − JavaScript helps in manipulating HTML page on the fly. This helps in adding and deleting any HTML tag very easily using JavaScript and modify your HTML to change its look and feel based on different devices and requirements.

3. User Notifications − You can use JavaScript to raise dynamic pop-ups on the webpages to give different types of notifications to your website visitors.

4. Back-end Data Loading − JavaScript provides Ajax library which helps in loading back-end data while you are doing some other processing. This really gives an amazing experience to your website visitors.

5. Presentations − JavaScript also provides the facility of creating presentations which gives website look and feel. JavaScript provides RevealJS and BespokeJS libraries to build a web-based slide presentation.

6. Server Applications − Node JS is built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for building fast and scalable network applications. This is an event based library which helps in developing very sophisticated server applications including Web Servers.

7. Machine learning − Developers can use the ML5.js library to complete the task related to machine learning.

8. Game Developments − JavaScript contains multiple libraries and NPM packages to design graphics for the game. We can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with libraries to develop the games.

9. Mobile applications − We can use frameworks like React Native to build feature-rich mobile applications.

10. Internet of Things (IoT) − JavaScript is used to add functionality to devices like smartwatches, earbuds, etc.

11. Data visualization − JavaScript contains the libraries like D3.js to visualize the data efficiently. The D3.js is also used to prepare high-quality charts to visualize the data.

12. Cloud computing − We can use JavaScript in serverless computing platforms like Cloudflare and AWS lambda to write and deploy functions on the cloud.


## Using JavaScript

In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between `<script>` and `</script> ` tags.

```
<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";
</script>
```

In HTML, javascript can be added both in the *head* or in within the *body*.

### Eternal JavaScript

To use an external Javascript, create a new file, For example:
`myScript.js`

External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages.

JavaScript files have the file extension `.js`.

To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a `<script> `tag:

```
<script src="myScript.js"></script>
```

You can use as many script files as you need to. All you need to do is to add all the script files to your HTML file:

```
<script src="myScript1.js"></script>
<script src="myScript2.js"></script>
<script src="myScript3.js"></script>
```

#### External JavaScript Advantages

- It separates HTML and code
- It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
- Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads
